__ADDITIONAL USAGE NOTES__


<!-- ## Development (`src`, `lib` and the build process) -->
<!--  -->
<!-- **NOTE:** The source code for the component is in `src`. A transpiled CommonJS version (generated with Babel) is available in `lib` for use with node.js, browserify and webpack. A UMD bundle is also built to `dist`, which can be included without the need for any build system. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- To build, watch and serve the examples (which will also watch the component source), run `npm start`. If you just want to watch changes to `src` and rebuild `lib`, run `npm run watch` (this is useful if you are working with `npm link`). -->
